/**
 * Module bundlers compile small pieces of code into something larger and more
 * complex that can run in a web browser. These small pieces are just JavaScript
 * files, and dependencies between them are expressed by a module system
 * (https://webpack.js.org/concepts/modules).
 *
 * Module bundlers have this concept of an entry file. Instead of adding a few
 * script tags in the browser and letting them run, we let the bundler know
 * which file is the main file of our application. This is the file that should
 * bootstrap our entire application.
 *
 * Our bundler will start from that entry file, and it will try to understand
 * which files it depends on. Then, it will try to understand which files its
 * dependencies depend on. It will keep doing that until it figures out about
 * every module in our application, and how they depend on one another.
 *
 * This understanding of a project is called the dependency graph.
 *
 * In this example, we will create a dependency graph and use it to package
 * all of its modules in one bundle.
 *
 * Let's begin :)
 *
 * Please note: This is a very simplified example. Handling cases such as
 * circular dependencies, caching module exports, parsing each module just once
 * and others are skipped to make this example as simple as possible.

// about every module in our graph.

  // Before we get to the body of that function, we'll construct the object that
  // we'll pass to it as a parameter. Please note that this string that we're
  // building gets wrapped by two curly braces ({}) so for every module, we add
  // a string of this format: `key: value,`.
  graph.forEach(mod => {
    // Every module in the graph has an entry in this object. We use the
    // module's id as the key and an array for the value (we have 2 values for
    // every module).
    //
    // The first value is the code of each module wrapped with a function. This
    // is because modules should be scoped: Defining a variable in one module
    // shouldn't affect others or the global scope.
    //
    // Our modules, after we transpiled them, use the CommonJS module system:
    // They expect a `require`, a `module` and an `exports` objects to be
    // available. Those are not normally available in the browser so we'll
    // implement them and inject them into our function wrappers.
    //
    // For the second value, we stringify the mapping between a module and its
    // dependencies. This is an object that looks like this:
    // { './relative/path': 1 }.
    //
    // This is because the transpiled code of our modules has calls to
    // `require()` with relative paths. When this function is called, we should
    // be able to know which module in the graph corresponds to that relative
    // path for this module.

  // Finally, we implement the body of the self-invoking function.
  //
  // We start by creating a `require()` function: It accepts a module id and
  // looks for it in the `modules` object we constructed previously. We
  // destructure over the two-value array to get our function wrapper and the
  // mapping object.
  //
  // The code of our modules has calls to `require()` with relative file paths
  // instead of module ids. Our require function expects module ids. Also, two
  // modules might `require()` the same relative path but mean two different
  // modules.
  //
  // To handle that, when a module is required we create a new, dedicated
  // `require` function for it to use. It will be specific to that module and
  // will know to turn its relative paths into ids by using the module's
  // mapping object. The mapping object is exactly that, a mapping between
  // relative paths and module ids for that specific module.
  //
  // Lastly, with CommonJs, when a module is required, it can expose values by
  // mutating its `exports` object. The `exports` object, after it has been
  // changed by the module's code, is returned from the `require()` function.
