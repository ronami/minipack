/**
 * Developing software can be significantly easier if you break your project
 * into smaller separate pieces. Node.js has supported it for a long time,
 * however, on the web, we need tools like Webpack or Rollup to support it.
 *
 * Module bundlers compile small pieces of code into something larger and more
 * complex that can run in a web-browser. These small pieces are just JavaScript
 * files and dependencies between them are expressed via a module system
 * (https://webpack.js.org/concepts/modules).
 *
 * Our module bundler will processes our application statically: it will start
 * from an entry file, this file is the root of our application. It will
 * recursively build a dependency graph that includes every module our
 * application needs. Finally, it will package all of those modules into just
 * one bundle to be loaded by the browser.
 *
 * This is an ultra-simplified example. Handling cases such as circular
 * dependencies, caching module exports, parsing each module just once and
 * others are skipped to make this example as simple as possible.
 *
 * Let's begin :)

/**
 * Now we're defining a function that will take our list of modules and package
 * them into one bundle.
 *
 * Our bundle should include each module in our graph within its own scope.
 * This means, for instance, that defining a variable in one module shouldn't
 * affect others in the bundle.
 *
 * Our transpiled modules use the CommonJS module system: they expect a
 * function called 'require' to be available globally, along with a 'module'
 * and an 'exports' objects. Those variables are not normally available in a
 * browser, so we'll have to implement them.
 *
 * Our bundle, in essence, will have one self-invoking function. Something
 * like this:
 *
 * (function() {})()
 *
 * I will accept just one argument: an object with data about our modules.
 * That object will have module IDs as keys and a tuple (an array with two
 * values) for values.
 *
 * Here's is it again:
 *
 * (function(modules) {
 *   ...
 * })({
 *   0: [],
 *   1: [],
 * })
 *
 * The first value in the array will be a function to wrap the code of that
 * module to create a scope for it. It will also accept a require function, a
 * module object and an exports object that our module expects to be available
 * globally.
 *
 * Here's another part of the comics:
 *
 * (function(modules) {
 *   ...
 * })({
 *   0: [
 *      function (require, module, exports) {
 *        const message = require('./message');
 *        ...
 *      },
 *      { './message': 1 },
 *    ],
 *   1: [
 *      function (require, module, exports) {
 *        const {name} = require('./name');
 *        ...
 *      },
 *      { './name': 2 },
 *    ],
 * })
 *
 * Our function will then create an implementation of the require function and
 * require the entry module to fire up the application.
 *
 * Here's a rough look at it:
 *
 * (function(modules) {
 *   function require() { ... }
 *
 *   require(0);
 * })({
 *   0: [
 *      function (require, module, exports) {
 *        const message = require('./message');
 *        ...
 *      },
 *      { './message': 1 },
 *   ],
 *   1: [
 *      function (require, module, exports) {
 *        const {name} = require('./name');
 *        ...
 *      },
 *      { './name': 2 },
 *   ],
 * })
 *
 * Let's give it a go, huh?
