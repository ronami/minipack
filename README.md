> An simplified example of a modern module bundler written in JavaScript

### What's in it for me?

Most of us don't have to think too much about module bundlers in our day jobs. However, module bundlers are all around us, and if you're a web developer you are probably using module bundlers on a daily basis.

Having a good understanding of how popular tools like [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) or [Browserify](https://github.com/browserify/browserify) work is extremely helpful.

The purpose of this example is to help you understand how *most* module bundlers work, and that they're not as scary as you might think.

### Development

Start by installing dependencies:

```sh
$ npm install
```

And then run our script:

```sh
$ node run.js
```

### Awesome, where do I start?

Head on to the source code: [src/minipack.js](src/minipack.js).
